<div class="para">The structure of these notes might be jarring, but the goal is to facilitate rapid entry to inspired, independent investigations of interesting questions. Often books begin with discrete-time mathematical models (which are conceptually and mathematically interesting, but not of interest to most students), then spend a bit of time in one- and two-dimensional, continuous-time models (which are familiar and interesting, but time consuming and of limited applicability in many ’real-world’ situations). The goal here is introduce a few broad ideas of mathematical modeling and to take an early look at stochastic processes and to introduce modeling that scales to higher dimensional problems. Both of these approaches rely quite heavily on numerical tools.</div>
