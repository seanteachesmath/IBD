We take two closely spaced water samples to determine whether naegleria is on the rise or it is otherwise ‘safe’ to swim.

<div class="para">Today we really started with the <em class="emphasis">last</em> line in the derivation which assumed that only one event was possible (i.e., we can think that we immediately ignored that individuals that died in a short interval gave birth at the same time.).
