<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">What does a model look like?</span></h3> <div class="para">A model is a description of “how things change” (like the height of water in a water tower). Biologically similar things might change in very different ways and be governed by very different processes.</div> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Thinking about time.</span></h4> <div class="para">We should think about how the organisms, or components of our model, interact with one another.Dynamics of some plants and animals are characterized by discrete, non-overlapping generations.</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Insects might reproduce over just a few days and be dormant over the remainder of the year.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Plants might set seeds over a short season.</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para">Alternatively, we might have a set of measurements at a regular interval (e.g., 2-weeks) that we wish to explain. Many human diseases are often reported to organizations like CDC and WHO at weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly intervals (e.g, measles, cholera, HIV).</div> <div class="para">Other organisms like yeast, bacteria, mice, and so on, might be best described by ‘continuous-time’ dynamics.</div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Thinking about interactions.</span></h4> <div class="para">Interactions might be characterized as linear or non-linear.</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">From chemistry, “first-order reactions” are linear - exponential growth or decay result from first order reactions (linear-models).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Reactions with multiple reactants (interactions between Na and Cl, foxes and bunnies, humans and zombies are give rise to nonlinear models - products or functions state variables.</div></li>
</ul></div></section> <section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Do we always arrive at the same answer?</span></h4> <div class="para">Most of the models we study will be deterministic. This means our model (a set of rules, and initial conditions) will always give the same answer.</div> <div class="para">In contrast, some models can handle (random) variability between individuals or at different points in time. These are stochastic models, and while often more complicated, they allow us to ask and answer very different questions. As an example we’ll look at “birth-death process” models a bit later.</div></section></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="what-is-modeling.html#what-does-a-model-look-like">in-context</a></span>
