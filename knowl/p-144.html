<div class="para">Since we are focusing on the fates of individual cells, it is perhaps important to think in terms of integer-valued states. Let <span class="process-math">\(N_0=n\)</span> be the initial number of cells present, perhaps in come cell culture of a fascinating biological experiment. We should note that, while the process is discrete (in the number of cells), time is continuous. The number of animals changes by a single individual through births (to the right) and deaths (to the left) as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bdp.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">Figure 5.2.1</a>.</div>
