<p> A mathematical model is an abstract mathematical description of any
(biological) system, using logic, notation, and techniques of
mathematics. </p>

	example</title>

<p> Picture a tall, cylindrical water tower with radius <m>r</m> in
which the height of the water is <m>h</m>. We want to know how fast the
water level is dropping as we draw water from the bottom of the tank at
a fixed flow. Our situation relies on the following relationship between
volume of water and height of water. <me>(\text{change in
volume})\propto(\text{change in height})</me> But what is the actual
relationship between the two, and how do we replace
<sq><m>\propto</m></sq> with <sq><m>=</m></sq>? First, <me>V=\pi r^2
h,</me> and differentiating, <me>\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}} = \pi r^2
\frac{d^{} {h}}{d {t}^{}}.</me> </p>

<p> Pause to think about this. We want to know how the height
<m>h(t)</m> is changing as a function of time. We are thinking of a
cylinder with a fixed radius, <m>r</m>. We will assume that we are in
control of the outflow from the tank, <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^{} {V}}{d
{t}^{}}</m>. </p>

<p> We can write a model for the height, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}}{\pi r^2}.</me> </p>

<p> Let’s assume we fix the outflow at
<m>\displaystyle100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{ sec}}</m>, by adjusting
the outflow knob. The first consequence is that the volume of water in
the tank is decreasing, so that <m>\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {V}}{d
{t}^{}}</m> should be negative. </p>

<p> We’ll now use our model to study the dynamics of water depth in two
theoretical water tanks: one tall and thin and the other short and
thick. </p>

<p> When <m>r=10</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(10
\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft}}{\ text{sec}}.</me> So
that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in approximately 3
seconds. </p>

<p> When <m>r=100</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(100
\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{100\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft} }{\text{sec}}.</me> So
that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in approximately 5
minutes! </p>

<p> This model allows us to discuss two important and often confused
concepts in modeling: the distinction between parameters and (state)
variables. The <q>state variable</q> is the <sq>thing</sq> that we are
making an effort to model. Here it is the height, <m>h(t)</m> of the
water in the tower. Everything else - the outflow volume
<m>\left(\displaystyle \frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}\right)</m> and the
radius <m>(r)</m> is known, or under our control. We call these things
parameters. Changing parameters affects the evolution of state
variables. </p>

proteins, viruses, molecules. </p>

<paragraphs xml:id="what-does-a-model-look-like"> <title>What does a
model look like?</title>

	<p> A model is a description of <q>how things change</q> (like the
	height of water in a water tower). Biologically similar things might
	change in very different ways and be governed by very different
	processes. </p>


	<paragraphs xml:id="thinking-about-time"> <title>Thinking about
	time</title>

<p> We should think about how the organisms, or components of our model,
interact with one another.<!-- linebreak -->Dynamics of some plants and
animals are characterized by discrete, non-overlapping generations. </p>

<p><ul> <li> <p> Insects might reproduce over just a few days and be
dormant over the remainder of the year. </p> </li>

	<li> <p> Plants might set seeds over a short season. </p> </li>

</ul></p>

<p> Alternatively, we might have a set of measurements at a regular
interval (e.g., 2-weeks) that we wish to explain. Many human diseases
are often reported to organizations like CDC and WHO at weekly,
bi-weekly, or monthly intervals (e.g, measles, cholera, HIV). </p>

<p> Other organisms like yeast, bacteria, mice, and so on, might be best
described by <sq>continuous-time</sq> dynamics. </p>

	<title>Do we always arrive at the same answer?</title>

<p> Most of the models we study will be deterministic. This means our
model (a set of rules, and initial conditions) will always give the same
answer. </p>

<p> In contrast, some models can handle (random) variability between
individuals or at different points in time. These are stochastic models,
and while often more complicated, they allow us to ask and answer very
different questions. As an example we’ll look at <q>birth-death
process</q> models a bit later. </p>

<section xml:id = "sec-simple-1d-ode"> <title>Single differential
equation models</title> <introduction><p>We begin with a few traditional
(and a few not so traditional) population models in the form of single
differential equations. This provides an opportunity to introduce some
modeling ideas and to practice some techniques from calculus and
differential equations. </p>

<p>We will often use three related graphs: the phase line diagram (a
plot of the derivative against the function value), the solutions (a
plot of the value against time), and a bifurcation diagram (a plot of
the equilibrium against a parameter of interest).</p> </introduction>

<subsection xml:id="sub-constant-harvesting"> <title>Logistic growth
with constant harvesting</title> <introduction><p>With a slight
modification to the logistic growth equation <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)</me> we can study the impact of a single,
relatively simple term on the analysis and the outcome.  We use
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - h</me> with
harvesting rate <m>h</m>. We will imagine the parameters <m>r</m> and
<m>K</m> as being out of our control, but <m>h</m> as being something we
might hope to control.</p
></introduction>

<p>A common approach is to draw and analyze phase lines,  compute
equilibria, sketch sample solutions, assess stability analytically,
verify that everything makes sense, and summarize what we learned with a
bifirucation diagram. It sometimes helps with one step to do another in
parallel, for example, the equilibria are relevant to the phase
plane.</p>

<paragraphs xml:id = "constant-harvesting-phase-lines"> <title>Phase

side of the differential equation is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - h,</me> a quadratic function of <m>N</m>.

but as <m>h</m> grows, the parabola is shifted down.</p> å </paragraphs>

<subsection xml:id="sub-proportional-harvesting"> <title>Logistic growth
with proportional harvesting</title> <introduction> <p>Admittedly, that
last section was kind of a nightmare, and the change we are about to
make might convince you things are only going to get worse.  Stick with
me. It gets better. </p> <p> You may have noticed some potential
drawbacks of constant harvesting. Chiefly, driving small populations to
extinction is probably not a good thing. Instead of a constant
harvesting rate, we will now take the term to be porportional to
population density, that is <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN</me>. Again, that is a more
complicated term than before, but the analysis will go much more
smoothly. </p>

<paragraphs xml:id = "proportional-harvesting-phase-lines"> <title>Phase
line analysis of the proportional harvesting model</title> <p>The
right-hand side of the differential equation is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN,</me> a quadratic function of
<m>N</m>. This is similar to the phase line for the regular logistic
growth model, but as <m>hN</m> grows, the parabola is again altered. 
Despite the model looking more complicated than in the previous section,
the analysis proceeds more smoothly.</p> </paragraphs>

<title>Equilibrium analysis of the proportional harvesting model</title>
<p>The right-hand side of the differential equation is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN,</me> a quadratic function of
<m>N</m>. This is similar to the equation for the regular logistic
growth model, but as <m>hN</m> grows, the parabola is again altered. 
Despite the model looking more complicated than in the previous section,
the analysis proceeds more smoothly.</p>

<p>Our equilibrium condition highlights the special value of <m>N</m>
which we call <m>N^*</m>, so we have <m>f(N^*) = 0</m>, or 
<me>rN^*\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - hN^* = 0.</me> First, we can
factor the right-hand side as <me>0 =
\left(r\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - h\right)N^*</me>.  From there we
get the trivial equilibrium <m>N^* = 0</m> and the nontrivial
equilibrium <m>N^* = K\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)</m> which solves
<me>r\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - h = 0.</me> This should make some
sense intuitively - if we set <m>h = 0</m>, our model reduces to the
logistic growth model <em>without</em> harvesting.  Notice that with
<m>h=0</m>, <me>N^* = K\left(1 - \frac{0}{r}\right) = K</me></p>
