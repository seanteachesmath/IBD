	example</title>

<p> Picture a tall, cylindrical water tower with radius <m>r</m> in
which the height of the water is <m>h</m>. We want to know how fast the
water level is dropping as we draw water from the bottom of the tank at
a fixed flow. Our situation relies on the following relationship between
volume of water and height of water. <me>(\text{change in
volume})\propto(\text{change in height})</me> But what is the actual
relationship between the two, and how do we replace
<sq><m>\propto</m></sq> with <sq><m>=</m></sq>? First, <me>V=\pi r^2
h,</me> and differentiating, <me>\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}} = \pi r^2
\frac{d^{} {h}}{d {t}^{}}.</me> </p>

<p> Pause to think about this. We want to know how the height
<m>h(t)</m> is changing as a function of time. We are thinking of a
cylinder with a fixed radius, <m>r</m>. We will assume that we are in
control of the outflow from the tank, <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^{} {V}}{d
{t}^{}}</m>. </p>

<p> We can write a model for the height, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{\frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}}{\pi r^2}.</me> </p>

<p> Let’s assume we fix the outflow at
<m>\displaystyle100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{ sec}}</m>, by adjusting
the outflow knob. The first consequence is that the volume of water in
the tank is decreasing, so that <m>\displaystyle\frac{d^{} {V}}{d
{t}^{}}</m> should be negative. </p>

<p> We’ll now use our model to study the dynamics of water depth in two
theoretical water tanks: one tall and thin and the other short and
thick. </p>

<p> When <m>r=10</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(10
\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft}}{\ text{sec}}.</me> So
that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in approximately 3
seconds. </p>

<p> When <m>r=100</m>, <me>\frac{d^{} {h}}{d
{t}^{}}=\frac{-100\,\frac{\text{ft}^3}{\text{sec }}}{\pi \times(100
\text{ft})^2}=-\frac{1}{100\pi}\,\frac{\text{ft} }{\text{sec}}.</me> So
that the water height <em>drops</em> about 1 foot in approximately 5
minutes! </p>

<p> This model allows us to discuss two important and often confused
concepts in modeling: the distinction between parameters and (state)
variables. The <q>state variable</q> is the <sq>thing</sq> that we are
making an effort to model. Here it is the height, <m>h(t)</m> of the
water in the tower. Everything else - the outflow volume
<m>\left(\displaystyle \frac{d^{} {V}}{d {t}^{}}\right)</m> and the
radius <m>(r)</m> is known, or under our control. We call these things
parameters. Changing parameters affects the evolution of state
variables. </p>

<section xml:id = "sec-simple-1d-ode"> <title>Single differential
equation models</title> <introduction><p>We begin with a few traditional
(and a few not so traditional) population models in the form of single
differential equations. This provides an opportunity to introduce some
modeling ideas and to practice some techniques from calculus and
differential equations. </p>

<p>We will often use three related graphs: the phase line diagram (a
plot of the derivative against the function value), the solutions (a
plot of the value against time), and a bifurcation diagram (a plot of
the equilibrium against a parameter of interest).</p> </introduction>

<subsection xml:id="sub-logistic-growth"> <title>Logistic growth</title>
<introduction><p>The logistic growth equation <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)</me> is often used as a model to describe
how the population (density) of some organism changes over time. The
model contains two parameters <m>r</m> and <m>K</m> that describe
properties of the organism under consideration. The parameter <m>r</m>
describes the <em>intrinsic growth rate</em> of the organism, while
<m>K</m> describes the <em>carrying capacity</em>. The intrinsic growth
rate, <m>r</m>, is the difference between natural birth and death rates,
<me>r = b - m,</me> for birth rate <m>b</m> and death rate <m>m</m>. The
carrying capacity, <m>K</m>, reflects the expected population size in a
given environment. </p> </introduction>

<paragraphs xml:id="sub-logistic-growth-analysis"> 
<title>Analysis of the logistic growth model</title><p>While this model
can be integrated using common calculus techniques, that formula, while
impressive, isn't actually all that interesting. In part because as
models become more complicated, we are often unable to find exact
solutions. Instead we will apply a mix of <em>qualitative</em> (i.e.,
descriptive) methods along side a few more detailed analytical methods.
</p> <p>We refer to the right-hand side of the differential equation is
the <em>rate function</em> and use intuition from calculus to learn
about solutions to the model. As a function of <m>N</m>, the rate
function is <m>f(N) = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)</m>, whose graph is a
concave down parabola with zeroes at <m>N=0</m> and <m>N=K</m>. This is
our first breakthrough.</p>

<p>Where the right-hand size is exactly zero, the derivative is also
zero. This means a population that starts at either number will never
change. We call locations like these <em>equilirbium points</em> or
<em>equilibria</em> of the model. These are helpful reference points
when describing solutions to the model. Elsewhere, we look at the graph
of the rate function to determine if it, hence the derivative, is
positive or negative. Where the rate function is positive, the
derivative is postitive, and our solution increases. Where the
derivative is small, the solutions increase slowly and where the
derivatgive is large, the solutions increase quickly. Where the
derivative is negative, the solution decreases. If the derivative is
negative and small in magnitude, the decrease is slow. If the derivative
is negative and large in magnitude, the decrease is fast.</p>

<p> We can turn this into a qualitative, graphical method of studying
solutions to this and many other models. We call the tool a <em>phase
line diagram</em>, and give a finished example in the <xref
ref="fig-logistic-phase"/>. In this example, the direction of arrow
points to the right if the value of the rate function (i.e., derivative)
is positive at that value of the model variable. We like to roughly
scale the size of the arrow by the height of the function to indicate of
the increase in value is fast or slow. In contrast, where the rate
function is negative, we draw arrows to the left. This indicates that
the solution decreases. </p>


<figure xml:id="fig-logistic-phase"> <caption>Phase line diagram for
logistic growth with parameters <m>r = 0.1</m> and <m>K =
100</m>.</caption> <image source="logistic-constant-0.png"/> </figure>


<p>Since negative populations are not biologically interesting, we tend
to ignore that direction. But you may notice in <xref
ref="fig-logistic-phase"/> that there is an "empty" circle at the value
of <m>N^* = 0</m> and a "filled" circle at the value of <m>N^*=K</m>. We
use this to indicate that <m>N^* = 0</m> is <em>unstable</em>, in the
sense that it repels solutions away from it (in this particular case, at
least in the positive direction which is all we are interested in).
Additionally, we cay that <m>N^* = K</m> is <em>stable</em>, in the
sense that it draws in all "nearby" solutions. In addition to the
graphical analysis, we can also study this computationally.</p>
</paragraphs>

<p>What's left is to consider what solutions against time might look
like, as in, a graph whose vertical axis is <m>N(t)</m> and whose
horizontal axis is <m>t</m>. According to <xref
ref="fig-logistic-phase"/>, if we started at a small initial population
just above zero, the population would slowly increase at first, but then
start to increase faster and faster as the population size moved towards
the peak of the rate function. In this phase, the graph would be concave
up and resemble an exponential. Once the population size got bigger than
the value where the rate function peaks, the increase would slow,
resulting in a change in concavity of the solution. The graph would take
on a "sigmoidal" or "S-shape". A population starting just below <m>K</m>
would slowly increase towards that same horizontal asymptote at <m>N =
K</m>. Solutions starting far above <m>K</m> would quickly decrease at
first, but would slow down and approach the asymptote from above (again
looking almost exponential).</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-logistic-sol"> <caption>Solutions for logistic
growth with parameters <m>r = 0.1</m> and <m>K = 100</m>.  Solutions
from three initial conditions (<m>N_0 = 10</m> in black, <m>N_0 =
\frac{K}{2} = 50</m> in gray, and <m>N_0 = 120</m> in gray) are shown
and equilibrium solutions at <m>N_0 = N^* = 0</m> (red, unstable) and
<m>N_0 = N^* = K</m> (blue, stable)</caption> <image
source="logistic-sol.png"/> </figure>

<p>Solutions starting from initial conditions below <m>\frac{K}{2}</m>
will always have the sigmoidal shape of the black curve in <xref
ref="fig-logistic-sol"/>.  Solutions starting between <m>\frac{K}{2}</m>
and <m>K</m> will look similar to the gray curve that approaches the
horizontal asymptote at <m>N=K</m> from below, and solutions starting
above <m>K</m> will always look like the curve approaching the asymptote
at <m>N = K</m> from above. </p>

<p>Aside from talking in more detail about parameter values in specific
applications, there isn't much more to say here. Along those lines,
however, changing <m>K</m> raises or lowers the horizontal asymptote
that guides our solutions and changing <m>r</m> increases or decreases
the speed at which solutions approach (or leave) equilibria. Next we
will consider modifications to this model that address how we might
harvest from a population.</p> </subsection>

<subsection xml:id="sub-constant-harvesting"> <title>Logistic growth
with constant harvesting</title> <introduction><p>With a slight
modification to the logistic growth equation <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)</me> we can study the impact of a single,
relatively simple term on the analysis and the outcome. We use
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - h</me> with
harvesting rate <m>h</m>. We will imagine the parameters <m>r</m> and
<m>K</m> as being out of our control, but <m>h</m> as being something we
might hope to control.</p> 

<p>A common approach is to draw and analyze phase lines, compute
equilibria, sketch sample solutions, assess stability analytically,
verify that everything makes sense, and summarize what we learned with a
bifirucation diagram. It sometimes helps with one step to do another in
parallel, for example, the equilibria are relevant to the phase
plane.</p>

<paragraphs xml:id = "constant-harvesting-phase-lines"> <title>Phase

This is similar to the phase line for the regular logistic growth model,
but as <m>h</m> grows, the parabola is shifted down.</p>

<p>The solutions below are computer-generated, but resemble nicer

phase lines in <xref ref="fig-logistic-const-sol"/>. Notice how the
equilibrium that had been fixed at <m>N^* = 0</m> now shifts upward as
<m>h</m> grows, this suggests small initial populations, that once grew
in the absense of harvesting, are now driven to extinction. Once the
equation reaches <m>N(t) =0</m>, that solution really stops making
biological sense.  In fact, it sometimes gets worse as those solutions
are essentially growing exponentially (but negative) and can cause
computational problems of minor importance but major annoyance. </p>

<p>An important observation from the graphs in <xref 
ref="fig-logistic-const-sol"/> is that the smaller equilibrium
establishes a minimum population size, below which all populations will
be driven to extinction by harvesting. Sadly, but somewhat
unsurprisingly, this minimum increases with <m>h</m>. </p> </paragraphs>

<p>We can, and sometimes must, confirm graphical results by complementing them with analysis.  The right-hand side of the differential equation is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - h,</me> a quadratic function of <m>N</m>.
We cannot factor, and instead can only rely on the quadratic formula -
it could be worse, but it's not great. To get anywhere in the next step,
it's helpful to expand the quadratic to <me>f(N) = -\frac{r}{K}N^{2} +

<paragraphs><title>Stability analysis motivated by the logistic growth model</title>

<p> For the remainder of this section, we will study the logistic growth
equation and variations. The logistic growth equation is given by,<me>\frac{d^{}
{N}}{d {t}^{}}=rN\Big(1-\frac{N}{K}\Big).</me> Let <m>N^*</m> be an
equilibrium point, so that we can write <m>N(t)=N^*+n(t).</m> We will
derive a stability condition for an arbitrary equilibrium point,
starting by identifying the dynamics of <m>n(t)</m>, <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=\frac{d^{} {}}{d
{t}^{}}\Big(N^*+n(t)\Big)\\ &amp;=0+\frac{d^{} {n}}{d
{t}^{}}.\end{aligned}</me> Now, substituting the formula for <m>N(t)</m>
and expanding, <me>\begin{aligned} \frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=
\frac{d^{} {N}}{d {t}^{}}\\ &amp;=r(N^*+n)\Big(1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)\\
&amp;=rN^*\Big(1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)+rn\Big (1-\frac{N^*+n}{K}\Big)\\
&amp;=\cancel{rN^*\Big(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\Big)}
-\frac{rN^*n}{K}+rn\Big(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\Big) -\cancel{\frac{rn^2}{K}}\\
&amp;=r\Big(1-\frac{2N^*}{K}\Big)n\\ \frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}&amp;=
f'(N^*)n\end{aligned}</me> In the last step we can see that the terms
that remain are equivalent to the derivative of <m>f(N)</m>, with
respect to <m>N</m> evaluated at <m>N^*</m>. Here we linearize by
substituting our formula for the solution and dropping al higher order
terms in <m>n(t)</m>. You could do this, more formally or generally, by
Taylor series. </p>

<p> Solutions to <me>\frac{d^{} {n}}{d {t}^{}}= f'(N^*)n</me> decay to
zero if <m>f'(N^*)&lt;0</m> and grow if <m>f'(N^*)&gt;0</m>. Hence, an
equilibrium point <m>N^*</m> (trivial or not) is stable if
<m>f'(N^*)&lt;0</m> and unstable if <m>f'(N^*)&gt;0</m>. </p>

<p> Evaluating derivatives should work in general, but it is not our
only tool. Today we will use graphical methods to develop a qualitative
understanding of the dynamics of a harvested population. If we think
about what our model means, we can make progress without tackling
sometimes frustrating, other times uninspiring, algebra. </p>

with proportional harvesting</title> <introduction> <p>Admittedly, that
last section was kind of a nightmare, and the change we are about to
make might convince you things are only going to get worse. Stick with
me. It gets better. </p>

<p> You may have noticed some potential drawbacks of constant
harvesting. Chiefly, driving small populations to extinction is probably
not a good thing. Instead of a constant harvesting rate, we will now
take the term to be porportional to population density, that is
<me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN</me>. Again, that
is a more complicated term than before, but the analysis will go much
more smoothly. </p>

<title>Equilibrium analysis of the proportional harvesting model</title>
<p>We can, and sometimes must, confirm graphical results by complementing them with analysis. The right-hand side of the differential equation is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN,</me> a quadratic function of
<m>N</m>. This is similar to the equation for the regular logistic
growth model, but as <m>hN</m> grows, the parabola is again altered.
Despite the model looking more complicated than in the previous section,
the analysis proceeds more smoothly.</p>

<p>Our equilibrium condition highlights the special value of <m>N</m>
which we call <m>N^*</m>, so we have <m>f(N^*) = 0</m>, or
<me>rN^*\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - hN^* = 0.</me> First, we can
factor the right-hand side as <me>0 =
\left(r\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - h\right)N^*</me>. From there we
get the trivial equilibrium <m>N^* = 0</m> and the nontrivial
equilibrium <m>N^* = K\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)</m> which solves
<me>r\left(1-\frac{N^*}{K}\right) - h = 0.</me> This should make some
sense intuitively - if we set <m>h = 0</m>, our model reduces to the
logistic growth model <em>without</em> harvesting. Notice that with
<m>h=0</m>, <me>N^* = K\left(1 - \frac{0}{r}\right) = K</me></p>

<p>First, we can factor the right-hand side as <me>0 =
\left(r\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - h\right)N</me>. </p> </paragraphs>

<title>Stability analysis of the proportional harvesting model</title>
<p>The stability of an equilibrium is determined by the sign of the
derivative of right-hand side of the differential equation when
evaluated at the equilibrium. Here the right-hand side is <me>f(N) =
rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN,</me> a quadratic function of
<m>N</m>, so the derivative, with respect to <m>N</m> is <me>f'(N) =
\dfrac{d}{dN}\left(rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - hN\right) =
r-\frac{2rN}{K}-h</me>. At <m>N^*=0</m>, <me>f'(0) = r-h</me>. At <m>N^*
= K\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)</m>,
<me>f'\left(K\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)\right) =
r-\frac{2rK\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)}{K}-h = h-r</me>. </p>

<p>When <m>r \gt h</m>, <m>f'\left(K\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)\right) =
h-r \gt 0</m> and the nontrivial equilibrium is stable, while <m>f'(0) =
r - h \gt 0</m> and the trivial population is stable. The population
equilibrates to some positive number when harvesting is week. In the
extreme, when <m>h = 0</m>, there is no harvesting and the model is
equivalent to the logistic model in terms of equilibria and stability.
Otherwise, for <m>h \gt r</m>, signs and stability are reversed and all
positive initial conditions lead to extinction.</p>
