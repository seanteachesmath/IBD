<title>Introduction to 2D systems</title>

<introduction> <p>To achieve our goals, a little bit
from the theory of differential equations is helpful. Ultimately we will
linearize a nonlinear system near equilibrium using
the Jacobian matrix.</p>
</introduction>

<p>Consider the generic 2D linear system 
<me>\begin{cases} \dfrac{dx}{dt} \amp = f(x, y)\\ \dfrac{dy}{dt} \amp =
g(x, y) \end{cases}</me> For the choice <m>f(x, y) = ax+by</m> and
<m>g(x,y) = cx+dy</m> (sorry about using the letter <m>d</m>, but it
becomes standard in the next step), it looks like <me>\begin{cases} 
\dfrac{dx}{dt} \amp = ax+by\\ \dfrac{dy}{dt} \amp = cx+dy \end{cases}</me>. It is convenient to express this in matrix-vector form, 
<me>\begin{pmatrix}\frac{dx}{dt}\\\frac{dy}{dt}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix}\cdot \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}.</me>
</p>
<p>We can establish some important information about solutions linked to properties of the matrix of coefficients 
<me>A = \begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix}</me>. 
Two important properties of this matrix are the <em>trace</em>
<me>\tau = \operatorname{Tr}(A) = a + d,</me> and the
<em>determinant</em> <me>\Delta = \operatorname{Det}(A) =
ad-bc.</me> </p>

<p>We begin by assuming that solutions to the system are exponential,
for example, <me>\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot e^{rt},</me> for some vector of
unknown constants <me>\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}.</me> Now we
differentiate and substitute,

<me>\dfrac{d}{dt}\left(\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix}\right) = \dfrac{d}{dt}\left(\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}e^{rt}\right) = 
\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot re^{rt}. </me> Equating these,
<me>  \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot re^{rt}}_{\begin{pmatrix}\frac{dx}{dt}\\\frac{dy}{dt}\end{pmatrix}} =
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot e^{rt}}_{\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix}\cdot \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}} </me> Moving all terms to
one side, <me>  0 = \begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot e^{rt} -
\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot re^{rt}.</me> Or, <me>  0 =
\left(\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix} -
rI\right)\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}\cdot e^{rt},</me> where
<m>I</m> is the <m>2\times2</m> identity matrix.</p>

<p>The exponential can never be zero, so we are looking for solutions to
<me> 0 = \left(\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d\end{pmatrix} -
rI\right)\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}</me>, which are given by the
eigenvector and eigenvalue of the matrix <m>A</m>.

Eigenvalues are given by solutions to <m>\operatorname{det}(A-rI)=0</m>
or <me>\operatorname{det}\begin{pmatrix}a-r\amp b\\c\amp
d-r\end{pmatrix} = 0.</me> We solve <m>(a-r)(d-r)-bc=0</m> for
<m>r</m>. </p>

<p>The equation can be written <m>r^2 - (a + d)r + ad-bc = 0</m> and
solved for <m>r</m> and then the eigenvector. Notice that the equation
can be rewritten in terms of the matrix properties referenced above,
<me>r^2 - \tau r + \Delta = 0.</me> The trace and determinant show up
once again. By the quadratic formula <me>r = \dfrac{\tau \pm
\sqrt{(-\tau)^2-4\Delta}}{2}.</me>  Frome here a lot could happen, depending
on the entries of the matrix and the resulting trace and determinant. 
Roots, <m>r</m>, could be 
<ul> 
<li><p>Real and distinct, opposite sign</p></li>
<li><p>Real and distinct, same sign</p></li>
<li><p>Real and repeated</p></li> 
<li><p>Complex</p></li>
 <li><p>Purely imaginary,</p></li> 
</ul> roughly in the order you might expect them based on past experience with the quadratic formula.
 What follows is the most economical summary I can provide of one of my favorite chapters in ordinary differential
equations. </p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-real-distinct-opposite">
<title>Real and distinct eigenvalues of opposite sign</title>
<introduction>
<p>As we will see in this section, this situation corresponds to phase
plane dynamics corresponding to a <em>saddle</em> at the equilibrium.</p>

<p> Real and distinct roots is probably the simplest case to introduce.
Let's call those solutions <m>r_+</m> and <m>r_-</m>, eventually we will
need numbers, but first it's worth pointing out how we find the
corresponding eigenvectors.  We find those by solving <me> 0 =
\begin{pmatrix}a - r_\pm\amp b\\c\amp d -
r_\pm\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}u_\pm\\v_\pm\end{pmatrix}.</me> The
subscripts indicate that in the case of real and distinct roots we will
have one pair of eigenvalue and eigenvector for each solution from the quadratic formula. 
</p>
</introduction>

<example xml:id = "ex-real-distinct-opposite-plane">
<statement>
Find nullclines, equilibria, and sketch sample solutions for the linear
system given by <me>\begin{cases}

<example xml:id = "ex-real-distinct-opposite">
<title>Real and distinct eigenvalues of opposite sign</title>
<statement>
Consider the matrix <me>\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 2\\4\amp 3\end{pmatrix}</me>.  The trace is <m>\tau = 1 + 3 = 4</m> and the determinant is <m>\Delta = (1)(3)-(2)(4) = -5</m>. Find both eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.
</statement>
<solution>
<p> Eigenvalues are solutions to <me>r^2-4r-5=0,</me> or <me>r_\pm = \dfrac{4\pm\sqrt{16-4(-5)}}{2} = \dfrac{4\pm\sqrt{36}}{2} = 2\pm3 = 5, -1.</me>  Substituting the eigenvalues one at a time, we can solve for entries in each eigenvector.</p>

<p> First, for <m>r_+ =  5</m> we have 
<me>\begin{pmatrix}(1 - 5)\amp 2\\3\amp (4 - 5)\end{pmatrix}\cdot \begin{pmatrix}u_+\\v_+\end{pmatrix} = 0</me> which corresponds to the system of equations
<me>\begin{cases} -4 u_+ + 2v_+ \amp = 0\\
 3 u_+  -1 v_+ \amp = 0\\
 \end{cases}</me>
The setup is very similar for the second eigenvalue, and solving these
both we have <m>r_+ = 5</m> with <m>u_+ = 1</m>
and <m>v_+ = 2</m> and <m>r_- = -1</m> with <m>u_-
= -1</m> and <m>v_- = 1</m>.
</p>
<p>In the phase plane, the eigenvectors represent what are called straight-line solutions. For example, in <xref ref = "fig-linear-saddle"/> we would have unstable straight-line solutions that grow away from <m>(0,0)</m> in both directions along along the line passing through the point <m>(1,2)</m>.  Similarly we have stable straight-line solutions that decay towards <m>(0,0)</m> on a line that passes through the point <m>(-1, 1)</m>.</p>
</solution>

</example>

<p>The conclusion to <xref ref="ex-real-distinct-opposite"/> means that for the
linear system of differential equations ... we can write solutions for
any initial condition in terms of unknowns <m>c_+ </m> and <m>c_-</m> as
<me>\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix} =
c_+\begin{pmatrix}u_+\\v_+\end{pmatrix}e^{r_{+}t} +
c_-\begin{pmatrix}u_-\\v_-\end{pmatrix}e^{r_{-}t}</me> <!--Since
<m>r_+\gt0</m> the solution will grow in proportion to the corresponding
eigenvector, while the contribution of the eigenvector corresponding to
<m>r_-\lt 0></m> will decay exponentially.--> </p>

<p>Some solutions will start on the first eigenvalue (this means an
initial condition <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> whose values are some constant
multiple of those of the first eigenvector.) The contribution of the
second eigenvector will be zero, and solutions will grow exponentially
away from the origin along the first eigenvector. Others will start on the second eigenvalue (this means an
initial condition <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> whose values are some constant
multiple of those of the second eigenvector.) The contribution of the
first eigenvector will be zero, and solutions will decay exponentially
towards the the origin along the second eigenvector. For all other
initial conditions we have a contribution from both, but with the
contribution of the first eigenvector growing and the contribution of
the second decaying exponentially over time.  We call this dynamic in the phase plane a <em>saddle</em>.</p>

<p>For example, with the initial condition <m>x_0 = 3</m> and <m>y_0=6</m>, we have <m>c_+ = 3</m> and <m>c_- = 0</m>. The solution grows exponentially in proportion to the vector.</p>

<p>By the quadratic formula, any complex roots must be distinct, but

</example>

<p>The conclusion to <xref ref="ex-complex-imaginary"/> might be
surprising. If you're aware of the complex plane, you might think we can
graph these. Unfortunately the complex plane has a real axis and an
imaginary axis. Or phase plane has two real axes corresponding to model
variables. So, as it is, we can't visualize complex eigenvalues in the
same way as real ones.
</p>

<p>This means that
we no longer start with real-valued solutions.  Recall that we guessed
that <m>e^{rt}</m>, was a part of our solution, but now we have
complex-valued exponentials since <m>r = \lambda + \mu i</m> for real numbers <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m>.  
Taking just this part, we have <me>e^{(\lambda + \mu i)t} = e^{\lambda t}\cdot e^{\mu i t}</me>.
By Euler's formula, we can write these as real-valued solutions that
involve products of trigonometric and exponential functions.  Solutions
will be purely trigonometric (closed periodic orbits) if the real part
of the eigenvalues is zero, and otherwise be damped or growing
oscillations in the phase plane if the real part is negative or
positive, respectively.  The trigonometric part comes from writing
<me>e^{\mu i t} = \cos(\mu t) + i\sin(\mu t)</me> using Euler's formula.
Since our goal here is just to lern about the linearized system, it
won't be especially helpful to pursue analytical solutions any longer at this
point.

<p>
The SI (or SIS) model that allows for the transmission of a mild infection through a closed population is a nice way to introduce 2D models.
</p>
</introduction>

<p>
Consider a mild infection circulating among members of a population, where the
<sq>healthy</sq> individuals are susceptible to the infection (<m>S</m>) and the
<sq>infectious</sq> individuals are capable of transmitting the infection to others
(<m>I</m>).

<p>
Much like in class we will build a word model as we go.
<me>\begin{aligned}
\text{change in }S &amp; = +\text{(gain from recovery)} - \text{(loss to infection)}\\
\text{change in }I &amp; = +\text{(gain from infection)} - \text{(loss to recovery)},
\end{aligned}</me> and replace
the terms with symbols. Our <sq>first</sq> term is <sq>loss to
recovery</sq> in the <m>I</m> equation. We can think of <m>\delta</m> as
the leaving rate from the <m>I</m> compartment, much like <m>m</m> was
the <sq>leaving rate from the living</sq> (i.e., dying) compartment of a
population model. Everything, in this model, that leaves one compartment
enters another (i.e., there are no <sq>leaks</sq>). We can also argue
for the infection rate as follows, since infection is only transmitted
directly and by infectious hosts, we might expect that the rate that
<m>S</m> individuals gain infection is proportional to the density
(individuals per hectare) of infectious individuals, <m>I</m>. In fact here, we
assume that the infection rate is a linearly increasing function of
<m>I</m>. There are plenty of other models of transmission, some we will
study in the homework, others later in the semester, still more in our
projects. 
</p>


<p>
<me>\begin{aligned}
 \text{change in }S &amp; = +\text{(gain from recovery)} &amp;&amp;-\text{(loss to infection)}\\
\frac{dS}{dt}&amp;= + \gamma I &amp;&amp; - {\beta I} S\\
\text{change in }I &amp; =  + \text{(gain from infection)}&amp;&amp; -\text{(loss to recovery)}\\
\frac{dI}{dt}&amp;= + \beta IS &amp;&amp; -{\gamma} I
\end{aligned}</me> 
</p>

<p>
<!--Consider <me>\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dS}{dt} \amp = \gamma I - \beta S I\\
\dfrac{dI}{dt} \amp = \beta S I - \gamma I
\end{cases}</me> -->
This model tracks the populations of individuals in two classes of a
population of size <m>N</m>.  Since there are only two classes, <m>N =
S+ I</m>.  Differentiating gives <me>\dfrac{dN}{dt} = \dfrac{dS}{dt} +
\dfrac{dI}{dt} = 0,</me> in words, the total population size is
constant. We can actually replace one of our differential equations with
an algebraic constraint given by <m>S = N - I</m>. This gives us a
chance to write our 2D system in 1D, meaning that this model may not
actually require any of our new tools.  We have <me>\dfrac{dI}{dt} =
\beta (N-I)I-\gamma I.</me>
With a little rewriting, this becomes <me>\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \beta N
I\left(1-\frac{I}{N}\right)-\gamma I</me>.  Looking closely, aside from
the letters being different, this is exactly the form of the logistic
growth model with proportional harvesting from <xref ref =
'sub-proportional-harvesting'/>. We could completely analyze this with steps
that parallel our work back there.  The threshold quantity for stability
relates the parameters <m>\beta</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>\gamma</m>.  Note
that <m>N</m> wasn't originally in our model, but was introduced in the
steps to eliminate the equation for <m>S</m>.  There was no reason we
would have known to do this, but it turned out that there was no reason
we couldn't do it.

Since this equilibrium is on the horizontal axis, reality suggests that it must be a stable node, not spiral - otherwise solutions would take on positive and negative values to spiral towards the equilibrium. Additionally, solutions could not cross the horizontal axis (a <m>C</m>-nullcline) with vertical motion.</p></li>
<li><p>At <m>(B^*, C^*) = \left(\dfrac{m}{\epsilon p}, \dfrac{r}{p}\left(1-\dfrac{m}{\epsilon p K}\right)\right)</m>, which is positive provided <m>K\gt \frac{m}{\epsilon p}</m>.

The trace is negative, so the nontrivial equilibrium will be stable provided the determinant is positive.

<p> Eigenvalues are solutions to <me>r^2-5r-2=0,</me> or <me>r_\pm = \dfrac{5\pm\sqrt{25-4(-2)}}{2} = \dfrac{5}{2}\pm\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}.</me>  Substituting the eigenvalues one at a time, we can solve for entries in each eigenvector.</p>

<p> First, for <m>r_+ =  \dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}</m> we have 
<me>\begin{pmatrix}1 - \left(\dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}\right)\amp 2\\3\amp 4 - \left(\dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}\right)\end{pmatrix}\cdot \begin{pmatrix}u_+\\v_+\end{pmatrix} = 0</me> which corresponds to the system of equations
<me>\begin{cases} \left(1 - \left(\dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}\right)\right) u_+ + 2v_+ \amp = 0\\
 3 u_+  \left(4 - \left(\dfrac{5}{2}+\dfrac{\sqrt{33}}{2}\right)\right)v_+ \amp = 0\\
 \end{cases}</me>
The setup is very similar for the second eigenvalue, and solving these
both we have <m>r_+ \approx 5.37228</m> with <m>u_+ \approx 0.457427</m>
