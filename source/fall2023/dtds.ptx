<title>What is a discrete-time dynamical system?</title>
<introduction>
<p>
A discrete-time dynamical system (DTDS), also known as a recurrence
relation or difference equation, is a way of generating a sequence of
numbers by repeatedly applying a calculation. The mechanics are similar
to the way we might calculate the Fibonacci or Pingala numbers starting from <m>F_0
= 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m> and continuing for <m>n \geq 2</m> with
<me>F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</me>.  Though this was an early example of
a mathematical model, and is well-described elsewhere, we will now look in other directions that have more biological relevance.

<title>A linear DTDS</title>
<introduction>
<p>
Suppose the amount of a radioactive medical tracer decays by <m>11\%</m>
per hour (in other words <m>89\%</m> persists into the next hour). If we take <m>x_{t}</m>
to be the amount at hour <m>t</m>, the DTDS is given by <me>x_{t+1} =
0.89x_{t}</me> starting from the initial amount <m>x_{0}</m>.  This
means <m>x_{1} = 0.89 x_{0}</m> and <m>x_{2} = 0.89 x_{1}</m>.  Since we
already know <m>x_{1}</m> in terms of <m>x_0</m>, we can write <m>x_{2}
= (0.89)^2x_{0}</m>.  This pattern extends to a <em>solution</em> of the
form <me>x_{t} = (0.89)^{t}x_{0}</me>.  In terms of <m>t</m>-dependence,
this is an exponential function, the form is a constant to a variable
power, but in discrete time we call this pattern geometric decay (or growth).
</p>
</introduction>

<p>By defining a function <m>x(t)</m> that is exact with <m>x_{t}</m> at
integer values and interpolates between, we can establish an important
connection between discrete and continuous dynamics.
Noticing that we can write <m>0.89 = e^{\ln(0.89)}</m>, then raising
each side to the power <m>t</m>, we have <me>(0.89)^{t} =
e^{\ln(0.89)t}</me>.  Now multiplying each side by the initial condition
<m>x_{0}</m>, we have that <m>x_{t} = (0.89)^{t}x_{0}</m> Similarly,
<m>x(t) = x_{0}e^{\ln(0.89)t}</m>. These are identical at integer values
of <m>t</m> and the exponential smoothly interpolates the geometric at
times in between the integer values.  Additionally this gives a
connection between the discrete growth factor, here <m>0.89</m>, and the
exponential (decay) rate <m>\ln(0.89) \approx -0.1165</m>.

<subsection xml:id = "sub-logistic-map">
<title>The logistic map</title>
<introduction>
<p>
A very famous model is called the logistic map, given by <me>x_{t+1} =
rx_{t}(1-x_{t})</me>. This <em>somewhat</em> parallels the continuous
logistic growth differential equation in its structure.  This is more
explicit if we instead write  <me>N_{t+1} =
rN_{t}\left(1-\dfrac{N_{t}}{K}\right)</me>.  Then we can let <m>x_{t} =
\dfrac{N_{t}}{K}</m> or <m> N_{t} = Kx_{t}</m>.  Substituting we have
<m>Kx_{t+1} = rKx_{t}(1-x_{t})</m> and after dividing the common
<m>K</m> we have <me>x_{t+1} = rx_{t}(1-x_{t})</me>, which matches the more common version stated earlier.
</p>
</introduction>



<example xml:id = "ex-logistic-r">
<title>The parameter <m>r</m></title>
<statement>
The model is defined for <m>0 \leq x_{t} \leq 1</m>.  To ensure that
<m>0 \leq x_{t+1} \leq 1</m> we have to be careful with the choice of
<m>r</m>.  Use calculus to find the maximum <m>r</m>-value to ensure
that the function doesn't exceed one in value.  You are welcome to write
the function as <m>f(x) = rx(1-x)</m> prior to beginning  your analysis.
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Below are a few cobwebbing diagrams and solutions plotted against time for a
variety of choices of <m>r</m>.  By moving from the updating function
horizontally to the diagonal line in the cobwebbing diagram, we are able to swap the horizontal
and vertical coordinates and as a result able to use the most recent
output value as the next input value to the updating function. Following
from the initial value, each time we hit the updating function on the
cobwebbing diagram, we append a new value to our solution.
