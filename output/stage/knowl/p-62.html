<div class="para">The solutions below are computer-generated, but resemble nicer versions of sketches we could make ourselves from the information in the phase lines in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-logistic-const-sol.html" title="Figure 1.2.4">FigureÂ 1.2.4</a>. Notice how the equilibrium that had been fixed at <span class="process-math">\(N^* = 0\)</span> now shifts upward as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> grows, this suggests small initial populations, that once grew in the absense of harvesting, are now driven to extinction. Once the equation reaches <span class="process-math">\(N(t) =0\text{,}\)</span> that solution really stops making biological sense.  In fact, it sometimes gets worse as those solutions are essentially growing exponentially (but negative) and can cause computational problems of minor importance but major annoyance.</div>
