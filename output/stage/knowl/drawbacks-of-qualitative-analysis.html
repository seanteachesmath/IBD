<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Drawbacks of qualitative analysis.</span></h4> <div class="para">Perhaps the biggest drawback of qualitative methods is that we are really limited to applying these approaches to models of lower dimension. These methods work well for models of 1 or 2 dimensions (i.e., variables). Occasionally we are lucky enough to have opportunities to view higher dimensional systems in lower dimension by clever analysis techniques, so we can stretch the territory of qualitative methods a bit in some cases. We are able to get <em class="emphasis">only</em> broad information about our solutions or the behaviors of our mode (if you omit the word only, however, this potential drawback looks suspiciously like a strength). We could distinguish between</div> <div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">oscillations or not, or</div></li>
<li><div class="para">growth or decay</div></li>
</ul></div> <div class="para">and identify conditions under which these behaviors occur.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="single-species-population-models.html#drawbacks-of-qualitative-analysis" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
