<div class="para">Where the right-hand size is exactly zero, the derivative is also zero. This means a population that starts at either number will never change. We call locations like these <em class="emphasis">equilirbium points</em> or <em class="emphasis">equilibria</em> of the model. These are helpful reference points when describing solutions to the model. Elsewhere, we look at the graph of the rate function to determine if it, hence the derivative, is positive or negative. Where the rate function is positive, the derivative is postitive, and our solution increases. Where the derivative is small, the solutions increase slowly and where the derivatgive is large, the solutions increase quickly. Where the derivative is negative, the solution decreases. If the derivative is negative and small in magnitude, the decrease is slow. If the derivative is negative and large in magnitude, the decrease is fast.</div>
