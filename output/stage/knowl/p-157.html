<div class="para">More interesting cases occur if, for example, <span class="process-math">\(r=8\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mu=2\text{,}\)</span> then the probability of a birth is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4}{5}\)</span> and the probability of a death is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5}\text{.}\)</span> To illustrate this last case, we divide the unit interval into subintervals <span class="process-math">\((0,
\frac{4}{5}]\text{,}\)</span> representing the probabilities of birth, and <span class="process-math">\((\frac{4}{5}, 1)\text{,}\)</span> representing the probabilities of death. Then we choose a uniform random number (a dart) and throw it at the divided number line (a target). The interval in which it lands identifies our next event. In this example, since <span class="process-math">\(r&gt;&gt;\mu\text{,}\)</span> the probability that a birth occurs is much larger than the probability that a death occurs. Thus, the birth interval in the target is much larger than the death interval, and we are more likely to have a birth.</div>
