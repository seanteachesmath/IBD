In this phase, the graph would be concave up and resemble an exponential. Once the population size got bigger than the value where the rate function peaks, the increase would slow, resulting in a change in concavity of the solution. The graph would take on a "sigmoidal" or "S-shape". A population starting just below <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> would slowly increase towards that same horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(N =
K\text{.}\)</span> Solutions starting far above <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> would quickly decrease at first, but would slow down and approach the asymptote from above (again looking almost exponential).</div>
