<div class="para">Sometimes we need to <em class="emphasis">normalize</em> the eigenvector or control its length, we aren’t concerned with that here. Additionally, for the first we could have just as easily chosen <span class="process-math">\(u_1 =
u_2 = -1\)</span> which would be a vector pointing in the opposite direction of what we’d first considered. Surprisingly, for most of our needs this doesn’t really matter - what matters most is the angle the vector points towards (in this case still along the line <span class="process-math">\(y = x\)</span>).</div>
