<div class="para">Since negative populations are not biologically interesting, we tend to ignore that direction. But you may notice in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-logistic-phase.html" title="Figure 1.2.1">FigureÂ 1.2.1</a> that there is an "empty" circle at the value of <span class="process-math">\(N^* = 0\)</span> and a "filled" circle at the value of <span class="process-math">\(N^*=K\text{.}\)</span> We use this to indicate that <span class="process-math">\(N^* = 0\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">unstable</em>, in the sense that it repels solutions away from it (in this particular case, at least in the positive direction which is all we are interested in). Additionally, we cay that <span class="process-math">\(N^* = K\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">stable</em>, in the sense that it draws in all "nearby" solutions. In addition to the graphical analysis, we can also study this computationally.</div>
