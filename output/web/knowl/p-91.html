<div class="para">Some solutions will start on the first eigenvalue (this means an initial condition <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> whose values are some constant multiple of those of the first eigenvector.) The contribution of the second eigenvector will be zero, and solutions will grow exponentially away from the origin along the first eigenvector. Others will start on the second eigenvalue (this means an initial condition <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> whose values are some constant multiple of those of the second eigenvector.) The contribution of the first eigenvector will be zero, and solutions will decay exponentially towards the the origin along the second eigenvector. For all other initial conditions we have a contribution from both, but with the contribution of the first eigenvector growing and the contribution of the second decaying exponentially over time.  We call this dynamic in the phase plane a <em class="emphasis">saddle</em>.</div>

<div class="para">If we hadn’t computed solutions, we wouldn’t necessarily know from the phase portrait that these solutions do not spiral in towards or out from the equilibrium. To know for certain, we would need to study the ‘linearized’ dynamics near each equilibrium point, including the point <span class="process-math">\((0, 0)\text{,}\)</span> as well. Since we have solutions, we might as well plot them in time (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-pred-prey.html" title="Figure 2.3.2">Figure 2.3.2</a>).</div>
