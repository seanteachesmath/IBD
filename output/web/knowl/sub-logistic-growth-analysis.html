<div class="para">While this model can be integrated using common calculus techniques, that formula, while impressive, isn’t actually all that interesting. In part because as models become more complicated, we are often unable to find exact solutions. Instead we will apply a mix of <em class="emphasis">qualitative</em> (i.e., descriptive) methods along side a few more detailed analytical methods.</div> <div class="para">We refer to the right-hand side of the differential equation is the <em class="emphasis">rate function</em> and use intuition from calculus to learn about solutions to the model. As a function of <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> the rate function is <span class="process-math">\(f(N) = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\text{,}\)</span> whose graph is a concave down parabola with zeroes at <span class="process-math">\(N=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N=K\text{.}\)</span> This is our first breakthrough.</div> <div class="para">Where the right-hand size is exactly zero, the derivative is also zero. This means a population that starts at either number will never change. We call locations like these <em class="emphasis">equilirbium points</em> or <em class="emphasis">equilibria</em> of the model. These are helpful reference points when describing solutions to the model. Elsewhere, we look at the graph of the rate function to determine if it, hence the derivative, is positive or negative. Where the rate function is positive, the derivative is postitive, and our solution increases. Where the derivative is small, the solutions increase slowly and where the derivatgive is large, the solutions increase quickly. Where the derivative is negative, the solution decreases. If the derivative is negative and small in magnitude, the decrease is slow. If the derivative is negative and large in magnitude, the decrease is fast.</div> <div class="para">We can turn this into a qualitative, graphical method of studying solutions to this and many other models. We call the tool a <em class="emphasis">phase line diagram</em>, and give a finished example in the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-logistic-phase.html" title="Figure 1.2.1">Figure 1.2.1</a>. In this example, the direction of arrow points to the right if the value of the rate function (i.e., derivative) is positive at that value of the model variable. We like to roughly scale the size of the arrow by the height of the function to indicate of the increase in value is fast or slow. In contrast, where the rate function is negative, we draw arrows to the left. This indicates that the solution decreases.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/logistic-constant-0.png" class="contained"></div>

But you may notice in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-logistic-phase.html" title="Figure 1.2.1">Figure 1.2.1</a> that there is an "empty" circle at the value of <span class="process-math">\(N^* = 0\)</span> and a "filled" circle at the value of <span class="process-math">\(N^*=K\text{.}\)</span> We use this to indicate that <span class="process-math">\(N^* = 0\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">unstable</em>, in the sense that it repels solutions away from it (in this particular case, at least in the positive direction which is all we are interested in). Additionally, we cay that <span class="process-math">\(N^* = K\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">stable</em>, in the sense that it draws in all "nearby" solutions. In addition to the graphical analysis, we can also study this computationally.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-simple-1d-ode.html#sub-logistic-growth-analysis">in-context</a></span>
