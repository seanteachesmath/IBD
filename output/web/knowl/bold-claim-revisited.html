<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Bold claim revisited.</span></h3> <div class="para">Previously, we claimed that all populations go to extinction (in the absence of immigration). If we wish to simulate the process described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bdp2.html" title="Figure 5.3.2">Figure 5.3.2</a>, we need to track a few pieces of information: the event that occurs (a birth or a death), and the time that the event occurs. =[draw, fill=white, minimum size=3em, circle] =[ fill=white, minimum size=3em, circle]</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Using Fig. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-bdp2.html" title="Figure 5.3.2">Figure 5.3.2</a>, the <em class="emphasis">probability</em> that a birth occurs as the ‘next event’ is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig-bdp2.html">
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{Prob}({\text{a birth}})=\frac{rn}{rn+\mu n}=
\frac{r}{r+\mu},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and similarly for a death,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig-bdp2.html">
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{Prob}({\text{a death}})=1-\operatorname{Prob}({\text{a birth}})=
1-\frac{r}{r+\mu}=\frac{\mu}{r+\mu}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">To determine what happens we consider the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1],\)</span> which we divide, here, into two subintervals whose widths reflect the event probabilities above. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(r=0\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(\mu&gt;0\)</span>), the probability of a birth is zero and probability of a death is one. In contrast, if <span class="process-math">\(\mu=0\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(r&gt;0\)</span>), then the probability of a death is zero and the probability of a birth is one.</div>
</div> <div class="para">More interesting cases occur if, for example, <span class="process-math">\(r=8\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mu=2\text{,}\)</span> then the probability of a birth is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4}{5}\)</span> and the probability of a death is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5}\text{.}\)</span> To illustrate this last case, we divide the unit interval into subintervals <span class="process-math">\((0,
\frac{4}{5}]\text{,}\)</span> representing the probabilities of birth, and <span class="process-math">\((\frac{4}{5}, 1)\text{,}\)</span> representing the probabilities of death. Then we choose a uniform random number (a dart) and throw it at the divided number line (a target). The interval in which it lands identifies our next event. In this example, since <span class="process-math">\(r&gt;&gt;\mu\text{,}\)</span> the probability that a birth occurs is much larger than the probability that a death occurs. Thus, the birth interval in the target is much larger than the death interval, and we are more likely to have a birth.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/./images/event_prob.png" class="contained"></div>

That said, here we have the less likely outcome of a death.</figcaption></figure> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Given that we can identify the event that occurs, our next task is to identify the time until the event occurs. Here we assume that he events occur at a constant rate</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\lambda=(r+\mu)n,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and that the time until the next event, <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> is exponentially distributed with parameter <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{.}\)</span> Thus,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
T\sim\exp(\lambda).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We can easily sample numbers from certain distributions. To sample exponentially distributed random numbers, we take advantage of its cumulative distribution function, <span class="process-math">\(F(t)=1-\exp(-\lambda t)\text{.}\)</span> We pick a uniform random number <span class="process-math">\(r_2\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> using <span class="process-math">\(r_2=F(t)\)</span> to find our even time.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned} r_2 &amp; =
F(t)\\ &amp;= 1-\exp(-\lambda t)\\ \exp(-\lambda t) &amp; = 1-r_2\\
-\lambda t &amp; =\ln(1-r_2)\\ t &amp;
=-\frac{\ln(1-r_2)}{\lambda}\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Importantly, since <span class="process-math">\(r_2\)</span> is a random number so is <span class="process-math">\(1-r_2\text{.}\)</span> In slight abuse of notation, we relabel the argument of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(\cdot)\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(1-r_2\text{,}\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(r_2\text{,}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
t =-\frac{\ln(r_2)}{\lambda}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(r_2\in(0,1)\text{,}\)</span> the logarithm is negative, so the negative in front ensures a positive event time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Now that we have identified both our event and the event eating time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> we simply update our state and repeat the process for until we reach either a fixed number of events, a fixed final time, or a population that becomes extinct (or reaches some other pre-specified condition). An example solution to the birth-death process is plotted in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-stoch-sample.html" title="Figure 5.3.4">Figure 5.3.4</a>, where unlike in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-in-class-sim.html" title="Figure 5.3.1">Figure 5.3.1</a> the rate of birth is non-zero.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/./images/sample.png" class="contained"></div>

In the absence of immigration, populations that remain finite are bound to reach extinction. They tend to do so rather quickly, after a string of bad luck.
