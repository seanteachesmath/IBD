<div class="para">These notes were originally written for MATH 056 at Swarthmore College and subsequently quite heavily modified for courses taught at the University of Central Oklahoma. This course was developed and taught as MATH 056 in Fall 2011, and subsequently as MATH 4910/5910 in the Spring of 2013, 2015, and 2017, 2021, and <em class="emphasis">Fall 2023</em>. These notes were inspired by a course that I took as a first year graduate student at the University of Utah which was taught by Fred Adler.</div>
