<div class="para">Previously (when thinking in discrete-time) we worked with fractions of survivors and now we are suddenly transitioning to working with rates. When we took <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t=1\)</span> unit of time it may have been easy enough to convince ourselves that the fraction of individuals that survive an interval of length <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t=1\)</span> unit was some number</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
q=1-m.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the fraction that die per unit time step. If we put the <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> back into the equation we see the intermediate,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
q\Delta t=1-m\Delta t.

<div class="para">We need this per unit time survival probability, <span class="process-math">\(0\leq q\Delta t\leq1,\)</span> which hopefully suggests that we need,</div>

0\leq 1-m\Delta t\leq1.

\frac{1}{\Delta t}.

<div class="para">So, when <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t=1\text{,}\)</span> as with our discrete-time models, we needed <span class="process-math">\(0\leq m\leq 1\text{.}\)</span> What we really need is the product <span class="process-math">\(m\Delta t\leq 1\text{,}\)</span> so that as <span class="process-math">\(\Delta
t\rightarrow0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> itself can become large and still preserve this inequality. In fact, as <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\rightarrow0\)</span> we allow <span class="process-math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\text{!}\)</span>
