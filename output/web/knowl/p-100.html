<div class="para">To understand interspecific competition, we need to understand the units and magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{.}\)</span> Roughly, <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span> translates from units of beetle density to an “effective ant density.” According to the ratio <span class="process-math">\(\frac{B}{K_A}\text{,}\)</span> beetles ‘fill’ some of the carrying capacity allotted to ants. Just how much of the capacity that they fill is given by the parameter <span class="process-math">\(\mu\text{,}\)</span> which when multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> gives the ‘ant equivalency’ of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> beetles. We will look more closely at the equation for <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> but note that we could make similar observations about the equation for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
